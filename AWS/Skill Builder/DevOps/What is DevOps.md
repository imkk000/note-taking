DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity

Manual processes throughout the application lifecycle are slow, [[inconsistent]], and [[error-prone]]. Teams supporting the software development lifecycle have traditionally been siloed. Specialized in their skill set, teams such as business, development, quality assurance, specialists, maintenance, and operations, have been separated from each other and require scheduled and rigid hand-offs. Even though these teams have a common goal of delivering and supporting the application, they also have their own priorities, tooling, and processes. It is difficult to achieve efficiencies when project members are reporting to different units and aimed for different targets.
