## The benefits of DevOps
Organizations of all sizes, from small startups to big enterprises, can benefit from adopting DevOps. Following are some of the main benefits of DevOps.

### Agility
Build a competitive advantage by anticipating market needs and quickly deliver value. Monitor your applications and support you development strategies with real data. Have development practices in place that allow teams to move at high velocity and continuously deliver controlled, small updates as needed
### ==Rapid delivery==
The core principles of adopting DevOps are continuous integration and continuous delivery, rapid feedback loop and continuous monitoring, which makes the processes of agile software development quicker and more efficient.
### Reliability
Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and observability practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.
### Scale
AWS provides services that help you practice DevOps at your company at scale. These tools automate manual tasks, help teams manage complex environments at scale, and keep engineers in control of the high velocity that is enabled by DevOps.
With AWS services you can manage a single instance of scale to thousands. Using these services help you make the most of flexible compute resources by simplifying provisioning, configuration, and scaling.
### Improved collaboration
Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values such as ownership and accountability. Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time. For example, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run, reduces handover periods between developers and operations.
### Security
The DevOps model uses automatic [[enforcement]] rules, [[Fine-Grained Access Control|fine-grained access control]], and configuration management techniques that help to move quickly while retaining leverage and ensuring compliance policies. For example, you can describe and then monitor enforcement at scale, using infrastructure as code and policy as code.
