# Problems
Traditional ways of developing software have proven slow and inefficient, and fail to support teams' efforts to quickly deliver stable, high-quality applications. Challenges of Waterfall development, monolithic applications, manual processes, and siloed team structures cause bottlenecks and delays.

# Examples
## Waterfall development
Waterfall development are slow, not iterative, resistant to change, and have long release cycles.
- Requirements are [[rigid]], set at project start, and will likely not change
- Development phases are [[silo|siloed]], each starting after the previous phase has ended. Each phase is supported by highly specialized teams
- Testing and security come after implementation, making corrective actions responsive and expensive

## Monolithic applications
Monolithic applications are hard to update and deploy
- Are developed and deployed as a unit, so when changes are made, the entire application must be redeployed
- Have tightly coupled functionality, so if the application is large enough, maintenance becomes an issue because developers have a hard time understanding the entire application
- Are implemented using s single development stack, so changing technology is difficult and costly
