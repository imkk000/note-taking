# Unit 42 - Passive 1 (is done/ was done)
## Case A
- When we use an **active verb**, we say what the subject does:
    - My grandfather was a builder. He built this house in 1981.
    - It's a big company. It employs two hundred people.
- When we use a **passive verb**, we say what happens to the subject:
    - 'How old is this house?' 'It was built in 1981.'
    - Two hundred people are employed by the company.

## Case B
- When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant:
    - A lot of money **was stolen** in the robbery.
    - **Is** this room **cleaned** every day?
- If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use **by**:
    - This house was built **by my grandfather**.
    - Two hundred people are employed **by the company**.

## Case C
- The passive is **be** (is/was etc.) + past participle (done/cleaned/seen etc.):
- The past participle often ends in **-ed**, but many important verbs are *irregular*.
