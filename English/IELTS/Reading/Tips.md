# Tips
- Structure
    - Look at tips for preparation
    - Look at tips for the exam itself

## Important
- All of these tips can be used in many types of questions
- They are designed to
    1. Save time
    2. Get more accurate answers
    3. Avoid silly mistakes
- We will practice them in Question Types Section, and you should use them in full tests
- Review them regularly and make them into your habit

## Organization of time
- Important to organize your preparation time well
- For example: 3 months to prepare, follow this structure
    - Month 1:
        - **70%** of time on Vocabulary, Reading and Listening
        - **30%** on Speaking/Writing
    - Month 2:
        - **50%** of time on Vocabulary, Reading and Listening
        - **50%** on Speaking/Writing
    - Month 3:
        - **30%** of time on Vocabulary, Reading and Listening
        - **70%** on Speaking/Writing
- Vocabulary, Reading and Listening = **foundation skills**
    - They take longer to learn but can be remembered for longer, because they are **passive**
- Speaking and Writing are **action skills**
    - They are based on the foundation skills, so they come after
    - They *get rusty* easily, so they should be practiced closed to the exam

## Reading Preparation 1
