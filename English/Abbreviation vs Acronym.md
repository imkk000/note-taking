# Abbreviation
- Short words
> An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. It can be created by taking the initial letters of each word in a phrase, by using only the significant letters of a word, or by omitting some letters. Abbreviations are not always pronounced as words themselves, and they might not create a new word.
## Examples
| Short | Long |
| --- | --- |
| Dr. | Doctor |
| etc. | et cetera |
# Acronym
- Specific words in short
> An acronym is a specific type of abbreviation formed by taking the initial letters of a phrase and creating a new word from those letters. Unlike standard abbreviations, acronyms are pronounced as words themselves and are often used to make longer phrases more convenient to say.
## Example

| --- | --- |
