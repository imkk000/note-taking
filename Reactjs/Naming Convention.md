React.js doesn't enforce strict naming conventions, but adopting consistent naming conventions is important to maintain code readability and collaboration within a team. Here's a summary of common React.js naming conventions:

1. **Component Names:**
   - Use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase) for naming components.
   - Name components descriptively based on their purpose or functionality.

   ```jsx
   // Good
   function UserProfile() {...}

   // Not recommended
   function user_profile() {...}
   ```

2. **Props:**
   - Use camelCase for prop names.
   - Props should be descriptive and concise, reflecting the data they represent.

   ```jsx
   // Good
   <Button color="primary" onClick={handleClick} />

   // Not recommended
   <Button primaryColor onClick={handleClick} />
   ```

3. **State Variables:**
   - Use camelCase for state variable names.
   - Prefix state variables with "is" or "has" for boolean values.
   - Name state variables based on their purpose or what they represent.

   ```jsx
   // Good
   const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

   // Not recommended
   const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
   ```

4. **Event Handlers:**
   - Prefix event handler functions with "handle" followed by the event or action.
   - Use camelCase for event handler names.

   ```jsx
   // Good
   function handleButtonClick() {...}

   // Not recommended
   function clickButton() {...}
   ```

5. **CSS Classes and Styles:**
   - Use lowercase and hyphen-separated names for CSS classes.
   - Use camelCase for inline styles.

   ```jsx
   // Good
   <div className="header-container" style={{ fontSize: '16px' }} />

   // Not recommended
   <div className="HeaderContainer" style={{ fontSize: '16px' }} />
   ```

6. **File Names:**
   - Use PascalCase for file names.
   - Name files based on the component they contain.

   ```
   // Good
   UserProfile.js

   // Not recommended
   user_profile.js
   ```

These conventions provide consistency and make your codebase more maintainable and understandable. While the above conventions are widely used, you can adapt them based on your team's preferences or any existing coding standards you follow. The key is to ensure that your code remains clean, consistent, and easy to understand for both you and your team members.
